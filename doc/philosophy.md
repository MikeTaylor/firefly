In accordance with [../README.md#manifesto](the project manifesto), our goal is to provide the necessary tooling and documentation to lower the barriers to participation in FOLIO, and to provide the means for a more varied and less monolithic ecosystem of available apps.

With this in mind, three principles govern our technical decisions.


## Open to anyone to contribute

We architecture that we create for app publication, discovery, installation, deployment and enabling should be available on an equal bases to anyone with the requisite technical skills. There should be no single point of control over any of these phases (although of course a given organization may exert control over its own deployments).

Since not all contributions are equal, doing this will entails certification. Each application will need to be digitally signed by the organization that vouches for it meeting whatever quality standards they find appropriate. (The FOLIO Technical Council could be one such organization; independent publishes such as Index Data could be others). Other agencies can offer additional certifications.
