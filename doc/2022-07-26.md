# Agenda for Thursday 28 July 2022

* Wayne's document about what a platform specification looks like **(link to follow)**
* What facilities are required by each role in [the Roles document](roles.md)
* What to do about [the present mod-app-manager dependency on GitHub](roles.md#unopinionated-vs-opinionated)
* Whether to [co-opt Module Descriptors to act as FAM files](folio-app-module-descriptor.md)
  * If we do this, then the natural place to get them from is Okapi-based registries, which means the GitHub dependency issue goes away.
* The new proposal for [certifying FAM packages](folio-app-metadata.md#certification)
