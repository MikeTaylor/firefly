# Representing platforms with FAM files

## Background

In the conception of a complete FOLIO installation that has evolved from the MAFIA discussions, a fairly complex multi-level structure has arisen:
* A FOLIO installaton supports multiple platforms
* A FOLIO installation also hosts several tenants
* Each tenant uses one of the available platforms, and selects a subset of the specific apps to include from the superset provided by the chosen platform
* Each platform contains multiple apps and modules
* Each app contains multiple modules
